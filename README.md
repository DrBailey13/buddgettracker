# budgettracker

## Installation

No installation is necessary

## Purpose
This application was created to show my ability to integrate PWA's with an application so if a user loses connection thier data will be cached until they are connected again.

## Functionality

When the Budget Tracker loses connection the service-worker.js file will cache the users data until a connection is regained.
